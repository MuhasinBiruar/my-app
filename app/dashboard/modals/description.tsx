It was held in our classroom, and I remember we were all excited to finally be done with the exams. We had a small celebration with our classmates, and this picture captures that joyful moment.`;

export const gradDesc = `This picture was taken during my graduation day from CCI. I remember feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness as I prepared to walk across the stage to receive my diploma. It was a significant milestone in my life, marking the end of one chapter and the beginning of another. 
This photo serves as a reminder of that special day and the hard work that led up to it. This was also the last time I saw
all of my classmates all the way from kindergarten to high school together. Roughly 12 years of friendship and memories were formed here.
I was never an honor kind of student but during the last 3 years of high school, I managed to be part of the honor roll.
I graduated with being honor for the 10th grade. The day was filled with happiness as we celebrated our achievements and looked forward to the future.
Overall, this picture holds a special place in my heart as it represents not only my academic accomplishments but also the friendships and memories that I made during my time at CCI.`;
